🎯 ***What I am Currently Working On:***

- 📊 I’m currently learning Machine Learning Methods, such as Classification and Regression
 
 
💙 ***What I Love About Data Science:***
- I enjoy playing with patterns until I can understand them and summarize them, both for my own mind and sanity, but also in order to speak with others about the possibilities within the patterns. Data and patterns provide hope; hope for improvement and growth. Displaying a visual of where any situation is at in its current state allows for others to take that visualization and project what it might become "if....". Communicating complex data provides an opportunity for collaboration and synergy, a framework to evaluate the present and visualize the future with a team of other people. I want to be a data scientist so I can communicate patterns that allow for hope and growth in the future and to collaborate with others who want to see that hope and growth come to fruition through logical, informed action.
 
 
💙 ***My Favorite Piece of Data Science Pipeline:***
- Ooooh, that's a tough one, because I really enjoy a number of areas. If I had to be stuck in one area forever though, I would say I love the storytelling/presentation/delivery aspect, because it provides the opportunity to organize a lot of messy information into a coherent linear picture of how to get from here to there. I also love adding those finishing visual touches that elevate a product from merely ✔️done✔️ to ✨polished✨!
